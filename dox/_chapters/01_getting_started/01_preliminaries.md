This library is written in `C++14`. It uses [STL](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp) and [Boost](http://www.boost.org/). This document aims at explaining the user on how to use mlpp and build programs using mlpp. Details on design decisions and in-depth explanations can be found at the [mlpp blog](https://cppml.wordpress.com/). The latest code version of mlpp can be found [here](https://github.com/thomasfannes/mlpp).
